Purpose: 

    The static example focuses on DSP/BIOS configuration. It shows how to
    - Use and configure various modules.
    - Create static Instances.
    - Modify Program level configuration parameters.

    This example has its own BIOS configuration script.
    The BIOS configuration package must be built before building the static 
    example.  Use the makefile in ./<platform_dir> to build the static 
    example. If using CCS build depend.pjt first before building static.pjt 
    in the ./<platform_dir> subdirectory.

Expected output:
	
    See static.k file.
