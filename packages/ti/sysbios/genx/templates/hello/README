Purpose: 

    The hello example serves as a basic sanity check program for DSP/BIOS. It
    demonstrates how to print the string "hello world" to stdout. The DSP/BIOS 
    configuration script for this example is located in the ../common directory. 
    It is therefore necessary to build the ../common/<platform_dir> 
    subdirectory before building the hello example. 
    
    The ../common/<platform_dir> subdirectory can be built using the makefile 
    or the depend.pjt present at ../common/<platform_dir>. 
    The hello example can be built using the makefile or hello.pjt file located 
    in the ./<platform_dir> subdirectory.

Expected output:
	
    See hello.k file.
