Purpose:
    
    The RTA stairstep example runs continusously and periodically 
    generates log events. 
    
    The execution time is divided into a repeating block of 4 phases 
    lasting 25 seconds each.

    Each phase is further divided into 5 subphases lasting 5 seconds each.

    In each subphase, a single thread type (Hwi, Swi, Task) or 
    combination of thread types runs for a pre-set length of time in 
    order to present a CPU load of a its thread type to the
    system. The thread loads can be tracked individually or collectively
    using the various RTA GUI tools provided in CCS.

    RTA support is added by including RTDX and the ti.sysbios.rta.Agent module.
    See the stairstep.cfg file for more configuration details.
    
    IMPORTANT: This example uses RTDX and has some special requirements for it
    to work properly.
      1. Ensure that the RTDX protocol (simulator, jtag, or high speed) is 
         configured correctly for your platform.
      2. The ti.rtdx and ti.sdo.io packages must be on your package path in
         order to build the example.

Expected output:

    The example will run for about 2 minutes. No console output is
    generated. Use the CCS XDCLog, BIOS Execution, CPU Load, and Task Load
    RTA GUI tools to monitor the RTA traffic.
