 *   Generate SYS/BIOS examples
 *
 *   This command line tool generates SYS/BIOS examples. The only
 *   required argument is the output directory. This tool generates 
 *   examples for all targets and platforms specified in the config.bld
 *   file. 
 *
 *   A target and a platform are optional arguments and override
 *   those specified in config.bld.
 *
 *   This tool generates several examples each in their own sub-directory.
 *   It also generates a common sub-directory. Many of the examples depend
 *   on the common directory.
