</span>    41    <span class="xdoc"> *
</span>    42    <span class="xdoc"> *  This package supports SYS/BIOS programs which are built and run as
</span>    43    <span class="xdoc"> *  native Windows executables. This enables applications to be
</span>    44    <span class="xdoc"> *  developed and tested on Windows using native Windows development
</span>    45    <span class="xdoc"> *  tools.
</span>    46    <span class="xdoc"> *
</span>    47    <span class="xdoc"> *  Although this package emulates timers and interrupts, special
</span>    48    <span class="xdoc"> *  consideration must be given to the fact that Windows is not a
</span>    49    <span class="xdoc"> *  real-time operating system. A program will not run in real-time
</span>    50    <span class="xdoc"> *  nor is it cycle equivalent to a target program.
</span>    51    <span class="xdoc"> *
</span>    52    <span class="xdoc"> *  On Windows, the timer period may be programmed to as little as
</span>    53    <span class="xdoc"> *  one millisecond, however, the actual minimum timer period is
</span>    54    <span class="xdoc"> *  10 - 15 milliseconds. This latency results from the Windows clock
</span>    55    <span class="xdoc"> *  ticking at 10 milliseconds with additional delays in the Windows
</span>    56    <span class="xdoc"> *  kernel. See below for more details on clock rate considerations.
</span>    57    <span class="xdoc"> *
</span>    58    <span class="xdoc"> *  This package emulates the C64+ DSP core with respect to hardware
</span>    59    <span class="xdoc"> *  interrupt handling and dispatching. Currently, the only supported
</span>    60    <span class="xdoc"> *  platform is host.platform.PC.
</span>    61    <span class="xdoc"> *
</span>    62    <span class="xdoc"> *  <b>@a(Motivation)</b>
</span>    63    <span class="xdoc"> *  You can use SYS/BIOS emulation on Windows to model your application
</span>    64    <span class="xdoc"> *  on a high-level operating system before moving to simulators or
</span>    65    <span class="xdoc"> *  hardware.
</span>    66    <span class="xdoc"> *
</span>    67    <span class="xdoc"> *  When developing a software module, such as a codec, a common practice
</span>    68    <span class="xdoc"> *  is to first write a "Golden C" version. Once the software is stable,
</span>    69    <span class="xdoc"> *  the Golden C version is used as a baseline for porting to specific
</span>    70    <span class="xdoc"> *  target platforms.
</span>    71    <span class="xdoc"> *
</span>    72    <span class="xdoc"> *  When developing the Golden C version, it is often preferable to do
</span>    73    <span class="xdoc"> *  this work on a High-Level Operating System (HLOS), such as Windows.
</span>    74    <span class="xdoc"> *  This allows the use of HLOS tool-chains for code profiling and
</span>    75    <span class="xdoc"> *  validation. Providing a SYS/BIOS Emulation layer that runs on Windows
</span>    76    <span class="xdoc"> *  makes this effort more efficient. It allows a native SYS/BIOS application
</span>    77    <span class="xdoc"> *  to be built and run as a native Windows executable.
</span>    78    <span class="xdoc"> *
</span>    79    <span class="xdoc"> *  <b>@a(High_Level_Description)</b>
</span>    80    <span class="xdoc"> *  SYS/BIOS emulation is supported by implementing the platform proxy
</span>    81    <span class="xdoc"> *  modules for Windows. These modules are contained in the
</span>    82    <span class="xdoc"> *  ti.sysbios.family.windows package. These proxy modules provide
</span>    83    <span class="xdoc"> *  interfaces for the following:
</span>    84    <span class="xdoc"> *
</span>    85    <span class="xdoc"> *  <b>@p(blist)</b>
</span>    86    <span class="xdoc"> *  - hardware interrupts
</span>    87    <span class="xdoc"> *  - thread context switching
</span>    88    <span class="xdoc"> *  - general purpose timers
</span>    89    <span class="xdoc"> *  - system clock tick counter
</span>    90    <span class="xdoc"> *  <b>@p</b>
</span>    91    <span class="xdoc"> *
</span>    92    <span class="xdoc"> *  To implement these interfaces, some hardware functionality is
</span>    93    <span class="xdoc"> *  emulated in the proxy modules because Windows does not allow
</span>    94    <span class="xdoc"> *  direct access to the hardware.
</span>    95    <span class="xdoc"> *
</span>    96    <span class="xdoc"> *  The following figure shows a block diagram of both a C64x+
</span>    97    <span class="xdoc"> *  implementation and a Windows implementation.

</span>   102    <span class="xdoc"> *
</span>   103    <span class="xdoc"> *  Application code written in C that makes only SYS/BIOS API calls
</span>   104    <span class="xdoc"> *  should not require any changes. However, any code written for
</span>   105    <span class="xdoc"> *  peripheral control will need to be replaced. Peripherals are
</span>   106    <span class="xdoc"> *  not modeled in the emulation package.
</span>   107    <span class="xdoc"> *
</span>   108    <span class="xdoc"> *  The SYS/BIOS Kernel does not require any changes. Through XDC
</span>   109    <span class="xdoc"> *  configuration, the kernel binds with the appropriate proxy
</span>   110    <span class="xdoc"> *  modules relevant to the target platform (that is, for the
</span>   111    <span class="xdoc"> *  Windows platform or a hardware platform).
</span>   112    <span class="xdoc"> *
</span>   113    <span class="xdoc"> *  When building the application, XDC configuration is used to
</span>   114    <span class="xdoc"> *  select the run-time platform. Through configuration options,
</span>   115    <span class="xdoc"> *  the application can bind with the appropriate modules that are
</span>   116    <span class="xdoc"> *  hardware or emulation specific. This will most likely pertain
</span>   117    <span class="xdoc"> *  to peripheral and/or test framework code.
</span>   118    <span class="xdoc"> *
</span>   119    <span class="xdoc"> *  On hardware platforms, peripheral devices typically raise interrupts
</span>   120    <span class="xdoc"> *  to the CPU which then invokes the Hwi dispatcher to service it.
</span>   121    <span class="xdoc"> *  To emulate this behavior, the SYS/BIOS emulation package simulates an
</span>   122    <span class="xdoc"> *  interrupt that preempts the currently running task and invokes the
</span>   123    <span class="xdoc"> *  Hwi dispatcher. This is done asynchronously with respect to SYS/BIOS
</span>   124    <span class="xdoc"> *  tasks.
</span>   125    <span class="xdoc"> *
</span>   126    <span class="xdoc"> *  The Windows emulation package faithfully emulates the SYS/BIOS scheduler
</span>   127    <span class="xdoc"> *  behavior. That is to say that task scheduling will occur in the same
</span>   128    <span class="xdoc"> *  order on Windows as on hardware. However, interrupts are not real-time.
</span>   129    <span class="xdoc"> *  Therefore, interrupt preemption will differ, and this may invoke the
</span>   130    <span class="xdoc"> *  scheduler in a different sequence than observed when running on hardware.
</span>   131    <span class="xdoc"> *
</span>   132    <span class="xdoc"> *  Windows Win32 API functions may be invoked alongside SYS/BIOS API
</span>   133    <span class="xdoc"> *  functions. This should be kept to a minimum in order to encourage
</span>   134    <span class="xdoc"> *  code encapsulation and to maximize code reuse between hardware and
</span>   135    <span class="xdoc"> *  the Windows platform.
</span>   136    <span class="xdoc"> *
</span>   137    <span class="xdoc"> *  <b>@a(Clock_Rate_Considerations)</b>
</span>   138    <span class="xdoc"> *  When running on Windows Emulation, the SYS/BIOS clock is configured to
</span>   139    <span class="xdoc"> *  tick much slower. This is necessary because the Windows clock ticks
</span>   140    <span class="xdoc"> *  slower than a typical hardware clock. Thus, any code that depends on
</span>   141    <span class="xdoc"> *  clock ticks, instead of wall clock duration, should take this into
</span>   142    <span class="xdoc"> *  account during the configuration phase.
</span>   143    <span class="xdoc"> *
</span>   144    <span class="xdoc"> *  For example, if {<b>@link</b> ti.sysbios.knl.Task#sleep Task_sleep(500)} is
</span>   145    <span class="xdoc"> *  called on a hardware platform where the SYS/BIOS clock ticks every one
</span>   146    <span class="xdoc"> *  millisecond (resulting in a 500 millisecond sleep period), then the
</span>   147    <span class="xdoc"> *  sleep period should be normalized for the Windows platform using the
</span>   148    <span class="xdoc"> *  following formula:

</span>   150    <span class="xdoc"> *  <b>@p(code)</b>
